  ##  Common test .1 --> [ Multi class classification ] 1Ô∏è‚É£
  
  ## Classification Task:       
  
  We are dealing with a classification problem where images need to be classified into two categories lenses or not lenses.
  
  ## Dataset: 

  ## Model Complexity:

  Since this is a binary classification task, so don't need an overly complex model. A simple model is sufficient 

  ## Stratagy Discussion

  ## 1. Choice of Framework :

  Both PyTorch and Keras are popular deep learning frameworks. They offer high-level APIs ans support for building neural networks. PyTorch provides more flexibility and contro over the model architecture and training process, which are benificial for experimentation.

  

## 2. Data Preparation :

Before building the model, need to preprocess tha dataset. this involves loading the images, resizing them to a uniform size, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Conclusion:

I choose pytorch for building the image classification model. it allows for easy experimentation and customization of the model architecture and training process.
